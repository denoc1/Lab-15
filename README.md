# Lab-15 - Sum of Primes

In this lab, you may use any of your methods from Lab 14.
The goal of this lab is to have the user enter two whole numbers â€“ a first and a last, with first < last.  (Note:  You can assume that the user enters the numbers correctly.  See bonus below.)


The output will be the sum of all of the prime numbers between (and including) the first number and the last number.  


For example, if the first number is 2 and the last number is 13, the output will be 41 (the sum of 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13)

Optional bonuses:


Bonus 1:  Write an error check into the program to check to be sure the first value entered is less than the last value entered.  Have the user re-enter the second number if this is not the case.


Bonus 2:  Build in a loop so that the user will repeatedly be asked for values, but if they type in a -1 for the initial value, the program ends.

Requirements
-	At least one FOR loop must be used in this program.
-	Header documentation must be included.
-	Any methods require documentation including description, preconditions, and post conditions.

Sample Output (With Bonus 2 working)


          Enter a positive integer.
          2
          Enter a larger integer.
          13
          The sum of the primes from 2 to 13 is 41
          
          Enter a positive integer.
          24
          Enter a larger integer.
          28
          The sum of the primes from 24 to 28 is 0  
          
          Enter a positive integer.
          -1
